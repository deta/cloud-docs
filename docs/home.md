#### Intro

Deta is a free cloud crafted with the developer and user experience at heart.

It is our mission to dramatically reduce the gap between ideas and working cloud applications.


#### Why is Deta Cloud free for ever?

We want anyone, at any age from anywhere in the world to experiment and build their ideas without worrying about limits of credit cards.

#### How are you going to make money?

We're working on a big, parallel product that we will be announcing soon. This product will be responsible for generating revenue.
Stay tuned!


#### Resources

To accomplish our mission, we offer a set of minimal-config cloud primitives:

1. **[Deta Base](#deta-base)** (beta): Instantly usable database with a feature-rich API.
2. **[Deta Micros](#deta-micros)** (beta): Deploy scalable Node & Python apps in seconds.
3. **[Deta Drive](#deta-drive)** (beta): Upload, host and serve images and files.
4. **Deta Auth** (soon): Effortless signup, login & accounts for your apps.


#### Local Development and the Deta CLI

Most developers like their local development flow. We provide a CLI that ties your local development workflow to your micro cloud, see:

- [Deta CLI](#deta-cli)
