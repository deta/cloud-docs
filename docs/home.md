### Intro

Deta is a micro-cloud crafted with the developer and user experience at heart.

It is our mission to dramatically reduce the gap between ideas and working cloud applications.

#### Resources

To accomplish our mission, we offer a set of minimal-config cloud primitives:

1. **[Deta Base](#deta-base)** (beta): Instantly useable database with a feature-rich API.
2. **[Deta Micros](#deta-micros)** (beta): Deploy scalable Node & Python apps in seconds.
3. **Deta Drive** (soon): Upload, host and serve images and files.
4. **Deta Auth** (soon): Effortless signup, login & accounts for your apps.

#### Local Development and the Deta CLI

Most developers like their local development flow. We provide a CLI that ties your local development workflow to your micro cloud, see:

- [Deta CLI](#deta-cli)

#### Support

If you have any questions, we provide a few ways to get help ASAP:
