Deta Base is a fully-managed, fast, scalable and secure NoSQL database with a focus on end-user simplicity. It offers a [UI](../base_ui) through which you can easily see, query, update and delete records in the database.

## What can Deta Base be used for?

Deta Base is great for projects where configuring and maintaining a database is overkill. 

Examples:
- Serverless Applications
- Internal Tools
- Stateful Integrations 
- Hackathons and Side Projects
- Prototyping

## Is my data secure?

Your data is encrypted and stored safely on AWS. Encryption keys are managed by AWS; AWS manages Exabytes of the world's most sensitive data.

## How do I start?

1. Log in to [Deta](https://web.deta.sh).
2. Grab your **Project Key** and your **Project ID** and start writing code in [Python](sdk.md), [Node.js](sdk.md), or over [HTTP](HTTP.md) wherever you need persistent data storage.
